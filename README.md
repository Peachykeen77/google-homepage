Project to replicate the Google Homepage.
No doubt like other students of The Odin Project this was my first attempt at putting together a webpage or doing anything in earnest with HTML and CSS.
The truth is, I struggled massively but I also enjoyed it.
I had gone through the tutorials on Freecodecamp alongside starting TOP and doing all the installation work so I decided not to revisit this.
In hindsight it would have benefitted me to re-do the tutorials with context as I ended up doing some of this anyway!
After sevral evenings I managed to get the elements on the page in roughly the right order but positioning proved to be the most challenging aspect.
I used several resources on youtube and across the internet including two Freecodecamp courses on HTML and CSS, Dani Krossing's video on linking HTML to CSS, Code with Leanne's guide to using Material Icons, Julio Codes guide to setting up Browser Auto Reresh in conjunction with the Live Server Extension in VS Code.
I ultimately also used Wittcode's video on building the Google homepage to get the project over the line.
I did feel guilty about resorting to what is essentially a complete guide to guilding the page from scratch but I used it on the following basis:
I had to largely use what I already had in place, I couldn't just remove everything and start again but I could take the methods in the video and adapt them, which I did for the most part, except for the @media CSS at the end
