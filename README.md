Project to replicate the Google Homepage.

No doubt like other students of The Odin Project this was my first attempt at putting together a webpage or doing anything in earnest with HTML and CSS.

The truth is, I struggled massively but I also enjoyed it.

I had gone through the tutorials on Freecodecamp alongside starting TOP and doing all the installation work so I decided not to revisit this.

In hindsight it would have benefitted me to re-do the tutorials with context as I ended up doing some of this anyway!

After several evenings I managed to get the elements on the page in roughly the right order but positioning proved to be the most challenging aspect.

I'm working on a laptop and ended up splitting the screen with code on the right and the webpage on the left. Having got the elements where I need them to be I found that it didn't work when I maximised the web page as the elements lost their positioning entirely and the Google logo that appeared to be appropriately sized took on comedic proportions on maximisation!

I used several resources on youtube and across the internet including two Freecodecamp courses on HTML and CSS, Dani Krossing's video on linking HTML to CSS, Code with Leanne's guide to using Material Icons, Julio Codes guide to setting up 
Browser Auto Reresh in conjunction with the Live Server Extension in VS Code and the flexbox froggy link from TOP.

I ultimately also used Wittcode's video on building the Google homepage to get the project over the line.

I did feel guilty about resorting to what is essentially a complete guide to guilding the page from scratch but I used it on the following basis:

I had to largely use what I already had in place, I couldn't just remove everything and start again but I could take the methods in the video and adapt them, which I did for the most part, except for the @media CSS at the end which is borrowed almost entirely as it's a touch I wouldn't have considered adding.

What I learnt from this was as follows: 

That nesting is an important function to use when splitting elements within a div or other tag in order to manipulate them effectively.

The nesting approach also works well when working with flexboxes (I used this approach to move the mic and mag glass icons within the search bar otherwise they would have been stuck at the top of the search bar instead of in the middle).

Viewport height (vh) and width (vw) are really useful when working with images and getting them to size correctly when the webpage changes size. Wittcode shows you how to colour the google letters by treating the "Google" logo as a paragraph and then altering the colour of each letter individually.

I stuck with the image link I was using via TOP and was able to resize it using viewport %'s instead of absolute sizing.

Overall I still have lots to learn, in particular:

- Plan out the location of all of the elements on the webpage, including which divs are going to be nested and grouped together as such.
- Which elements are going to form sub-groups within a larger group.
- Revisit the freecodecamp tutorials now I have some more context for them (particularly anything that will now make more sense with that context of having tried to create a webpage).
- Go over flexbox again to learn all of the possible options for moving elements within the flexbox.
- Learn grid as it looks as though it will be really useful for future projects especially the calculator.
